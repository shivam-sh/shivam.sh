      <h5>Hey, I'm Shivam ðŸ‘‹</h5>
      <p>
        I built this website to showcase some of my projects, explorations, and
        experiences. I love pushing the boundaries with technology, design, and
        interactions to uncover innovative solutions and creative designs.
        <br />
        This lets me learn about the creative design of the hardware and
        software we interact with, while learning new things along the way.
